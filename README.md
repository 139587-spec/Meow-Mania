Heyyy!! My name is Avantika Satheesh and I build this interactive clicker game! Ever since I was like 10 years old, I was always obsessed with clicker game and would play them until my fingers got tired.
I loved collecting the awards and watching myself progress through the game. That's why when I had the oppurtunity to make my own game, a clicker game seemed like the perfect option. This is a reletively
simple game, but I promise it is fun!  The game revolves around clicking the big yarn in the middle, and from there you can ugprade to different patterns like blankets and beds. You can also earn 
automatic clicks, and helpers, which are cute kittens, to help you. There are also popups that show up every once in a while to give you a small reward! All of this can be received by collecting treats,
which can be earned by, guess what, clicking the yarn button! You can earn achievements throughout the game when you reach checkpoints. This is all cat themed, so for anyone that is obsessed with cats 
like me, feel free to nerd out:)))

With much love - Avantika Satheesh
